"# CSCI455-FinalProject" 
This is the repository for our CSCI-455: Database Management Systems.

The project's goal was to design an Electronic Medical Records Keeping System.

It was developed by Collin L. Ferguson, Angelina M. Toste, and John Guido, and Daisy Codenys.

This project was designed using C# and Visual Studio 2022 and was intended to be used with a MySQL database.
